# JS-Quickstart on Arrays

- 📗 [`a-backlog.js`](./a-backlog.js) - While not on arrays, it is a good "catch-up" on any items that might have only been briefly covered in class
- 📝 [`arg-parser.js`](./arg-parser.js) - Here we can work with an array we don't have to create. The `process.argv` property in the Node runtime will give us an array of values to explore.
- 📝 [`arrays.js`](./arrays.js) - Now it's our turn! Let's create some simple arrays and mess around with them. We'll even look at `.split`ting strings and `.join`ing arrays!
- 🚀 [`built-in-functions.js`](./built-in-functions.js) - All arrays in JavaScript have built-in functions to make working with arrays a whole lot easier!
