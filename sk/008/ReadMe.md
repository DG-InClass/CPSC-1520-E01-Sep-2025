## Overview

Events and event handling is a big part of why we write JavaScript. Review the [**Learning Outcome Guide**](./LOGs.md) for this starter kit.

Each of the demos in this starter kit already have the `package.json` ready for you. Just run `pnpm install` in each demo folder to install the 3rd-party packages, and then you can run `pnpm dev` to start the web server.

### Key Points

- [ ] 008 - ðŸ†• Event Listeners: button click, form submit, input change, etc.
  - [ ] Event Bubbling & Cancelling

## Ultra-Soft Intro

The code for this is all done for you. The task here is to read and understand&hellip;.

## Soft Intro

Follow the [instructions](./soft-intro/ReadMe.md) with me in class to complete the soft intro to Events.

## Demo Events

More examples of the types of events you can listen for are in the [demo-events](./demo-events/js/main.js) example.

## Demo Text Manipulation

This example is an opportunity to [explore events](./demo-text-manipulation/ReadMe.md) alongside the various string manipulation functions that we have access to.

### Form Processing

Our JavaScript is client-side, and we don't really have any server-side processing. In [this example](./form-processing/ReadMe.md), we'll introduce form processing on the client using JavaScript.
