# Choosing an API

One of the extremely cool things about APIs is that they can be a source of rich data - *lots* of rich data!

But finding an API to play with (especially if your goal is more about learning JavaScript) can be a pain. Here's three great APIs to get you started:

1. [RandomUser.me](https://randomuser.me/) - `https://randomuser.me/api/`
2. [Countries API](https://www.apicountries.com/docs/api/countries) - `https://www.apicountries.com/countries`
3. [DeckOfCardsAPI](https://deckofcardsapi.com/) - `https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/new/shuffle/?deck_count=1`
